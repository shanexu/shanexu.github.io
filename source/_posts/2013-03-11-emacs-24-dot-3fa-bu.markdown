首先恭喜一下Emacs 24.3发布。于是抽空把自己的emacs更新了下。

>**The current stable release is 24.3**. To obtain it, visit the [obtaining](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Obtaining) section.

>Emacs 24 has a wide variety of new features, including:

>* A packaging system and interface (M-x list-packages) for downloading and installing extensions. A default package archive is hosted by GNU and maintained by the Emacs developers.
>* Support for displaying and editing bidirectional text, including right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew.
>* Support for lexical scoping in Emacs Lisp.
>* Improvements to the Custom Themes system (M-x customize-themes).
>* Unified and improved completion system in many modes and packages.
